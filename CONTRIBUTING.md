# Code Contribution Folder Structure

## For Data Structures Code Folders
Example:
  * JavaScript-DSA `(folder)`
    * 01-Introduction `(folder)`
    * 02-Data-Structures `(folder)`
      * Linked-List `(folder)`
        * Operations `(folder)`
          * Singly-Linked-List `(folder)`
            - insertion.js or insertion.md `(file)`
            - deletion.js or deletion.md `(file)`
          * Doubly-Linked-List
            - insertion.js or insertion.md `(file)`
            - deletion.js or deletion.md `(file)`

## For Algorithms Code Folders
Example:
  * 03-Algorithms
    * Greedy Method `(folder)`
      * Fractional-Knapsack-Problem.cpp `(file)` 
    * Recursion `(folder)`
    * Divide and Conquer `(folder)`
